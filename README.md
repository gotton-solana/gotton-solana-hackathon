## **Overview**

Crypto Catcher GOTTON helps accelerate Solanaâ€™s proven two use cases; stablecoin and speculation.  
Log in with your wallet, purchase game tickets using USDC or BONK, and take control of real-life claw machines via your device for a chance to win crypto.

---

## **Platform Features**

### PvE

Take direct control of real-life claw machines via your device and aim to win crypto rewards.

- **Hardware**: With over five years of experience in the traditional claw machine industry, all 150+ machines are developed and operated fully in-house.
- **Broadcasting**: Each machine is equipped with two cameras (front and side view). Video feeds are streamed to the software system, which synchronises claw arm movements based on user input.
- **Software**: Handles live broadcasting, receives claw movement inputs, and verifies win/loss outcomes.
- **NFT Mechanics**: To ensure legal compliance, the game protocol uses NFTs to represent rewards (instead of direct token transfers). NFTs are pre-minted and held in an operational address. Upon a win, the NFT is automatically transferred to the connected wallet.
  - **Operational Address**: `HUQgbGNURsJNBUVAumz3rU3zx41cVtrevLpzXhyp1qW1`

### PvP and Live-streaming

Delegate your assets to streamers and let them play on your behalf. If they win, you earn rewards passively.

- **Status**: Currently undergoing battle testing in the developer environment.
- **Upcoming Update**: Prior to the PvP launch, the system will upgrade to support MPL-404 for escrow-based NFT-token swapping, enabling users to redeem NFTs for tokens at any time.
